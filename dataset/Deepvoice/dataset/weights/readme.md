chroma_stft: Short-time Fourier transform applied to the chroma feature, which represents the energy distribution across 12 different pitch classes.
rms: Root Mean Square value of the audio signal, representing the power of the audio signal.
spectral_centroid: Indicates where the center of mass of the spectrum is located and is a measure of the brightness of a sound.
spectral_bandwidth: The width of the band of light at one-half the peak maximum (or full width at half maximum [FWHM]) and is related to the complexity of the sound.
rolloff: The frequency below which a certain percentage of the total spectral energy, typically 85%, is contained.
zero_crossing_rate: The rate at which the signal changes sign, which can be used to measure the noisiness of the sound.
mfcc1 - mfcc20: Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) are coefficients that collectively make up an MFC. They are derived from a type of cepstral representation of the audio clip (a nonlinear “spectrum-of-a-spectrum”). These are commonly used in speech and music recognition and describe the overall shape of the spectral envelope.
